### Project Title
Exploration of bike-share data from three US cities

### Description
Bike-share data from the cities of Chicago, New York, and Washington were analyzed using python. The results of the analysis will be displayed to users based on their answers to specific questions built into the python code. Users will have an opportunity to select their city, month and day of interest; the option will also be available to analyze data for all months and days for the chosen city of interest.

The program will then display the most frequent times of travel, the most popular stations and trips, total and average trip duration, and user stats such as user type, gender and birthday info. Users will then have the choice to view some raw data; raw data will be provided five rows at a time for viewing of as many rows as possible. Users who do not want to view any raw data will be offered a choice to either continue with analyzing data using different inputs, or to terminate the program.
